%%% Multi-Stage rocket theory

% Goal: Minimization of gross lift-off weight

% 1st order Constraint: Specified mission constraints
Mu = 400; % Useful Payload mass in Kg
h = 300; % Target orbit altitude, assuming circular orbit, in Km

% constraints derived from 1st order ones, which are calculated depending
% on variables
